## What is Selenium ? 
#### Selenium is an open-source testing tool, which means it can be downloaded from the internet without spending anything. Selenium is a functional testing tool and also compatible with non-functional testing tools as well.

## Selenium WebDriver
Selenium WebDriver is a web framework that permits you to execute cross-browser tests. This tool is used for automating web-based application testing to verify that it performs expectedly.
Selenium WebDriver allows you to choose a programming language of your choice to create test scripts. As discussed earlier, it is an advancement over Selenium RC to overcome a few limitations. Selenium WebDriver is not capable of handling window components, but this drawback can be overcome by using tools like Sikuli, Auto IT, etc. <br>
